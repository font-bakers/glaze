## Installation

The latest release of `glaze` can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install glaze
```

## Usage

To use `glaze` as a library:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from glaze import render

fig = render(contours)  # Render one glyph
```

To run `glaze` on the command line:

```bash
glaze --input INPUT [--output OUTPUT]
```

`--input` is a `.json` file (such as those produced by `knead`), or a directory
containing such `.json` files.

`--output` is the path to the desired location of the output images. If
`--output` is not specified, it defaults to the present working directory.

Refer to our [quickstart](https://font-bakers.github.io/glaze/quickstart/) for
